# JSD
JSD (Java Structure Design) is a preprocessor which turns any [JSD schema](https://github.com/Xesau/JSD/blob/master/Lanaguage%20specification.md) into a lot of Java files which you can will in with your code.

### Why JSD
- Design your software in an easy language and worry about implementation later
- Auto generating classes, enums, interfaces
- Clear overview over project before actual coding > see design failures before coding
- After you set the configuration variables in the file, `php -f preprocessor.php` does all the work for you

### Validator
You can find a syntax validator [here](http://me.xesau.eu/jsd_syntax_checker.php)
